# Angular 8 Projects

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.3.

## How the Code is Organized

For every chapter of a specific section, there's a branch where you can find
the related code. That way it's easier to find the relevant code at any point
of time without following any complex folder structure.

Example - `git checkout 2.2` will take you to the relevant code for Section 2.2

To check all the available branches, do - `git branch`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
